# Elements-Translation
A Translation about Chemistry Elements(**Chinese**) and English

## Inspiration
The story took place during a **chemistry** class.

I communicated with a friend by passing **notes**.

I was on **far** left, and she was on **far** right.

There's a **lot** of classmates between us.

I wasn't **sure** if they would read the notes.

I guess **yes**.

I must use **Elements' name**.

For example, "钬钨 **硅LL钇** 钇氧铀 氩E" means "How **silly** you are".

That it's **NOT** easy to understand what we said **anymore**.

After that, I thought it's **interesting**, right?

So I made a meaningless but interesting **Elements Translation**.

## Function
From English to Elements or from Elements to English.

"For" -> "氟氧R"

"EX镅磷LE" -> "example"
